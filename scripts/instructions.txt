Packages you need:

pandas
rdkit 
seaborn
matplotlib

* some scripts will run in parallel. They are set to run with all avail processors, make sure to change that if needed. 

HOW TO RUN SCRIPTS:

1. script_1_filterframeworks.py library.csv
<filename.csv> is your .csv file with the chemical structures (SMILES) as the first column and ID as the second column.
This script run over all molecules and sort them into new .csv files to each framweork in "/smarts_files/smarts_frameworks.csv".

I recommend naming your library file as "library.csv". 
This it will create a folder called "frameworks" and the files: "library_pyridine.csv", "library_furan.csv" (...) which will be used later on.

2. script_2_reactions.py frameworks.txt 
<frameworks.txt> contains the name of each framework. This script will read each framework.csv file and run all RDKit reactions for that framework.
The resulting .csv will be written to the products folder. 

3. script_3_clean_repeated_smiles.py products/
This script will remove any duplicates in the products files. The cleaned files will be saved to "cleaned_products/" folder. 

4. script_4_find_comparisons.py cleaned_products/
This script will create a file containing the comparisons that will be done. 

5. script_5_compare.py comparing.txt 
This will compare product SMILES with compound SMILES in the original library and count the number of new compounds and known compounds.

6. script_6_extracting_results.py
This will extract all the important results and create a matrix to be plotted as a heatmap. 

7.  script_7_heatmap.py
This will plot the heatmap.
